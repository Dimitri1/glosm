                  traffic-simulation builded on glosm 0.0.3
                  =========================================


It is important to read this file to understand 
what have been already done for this project, 
and to understand the principle of testing and launching. 

Some important diagrams are available on doc/dia.
There are .dia file , so you need to install dia.
(sudo apt-get install dia). 

Especially : 
	-> UML diagram of trafin simlation
 	-> Diagram of algo principle of the traffic simu
	-> Architecture of glosm, light 
	-> Simple diagram about compilation system

For the glosm compilation , see the README of glosm "README".
All the required library are referenced in it.
Once all is ready , just launch 

cmake .. && sudo apt-get install

to compile trafic-simlation & glosm.




About the traffic-simulation Project : 
--------------------------------------



Advancement : 
=============

At now , the traffic-simulation is in on a very early stage of development.
It is on a stage of implementation of CarHandler class.


The last features witches have been implemented and tested 
are : 

GetPointsTrajectoryFromTo(.. ) ;  
WriteTrajectory(..)  ;    	Carglosm.cc



Usage of traffic-simulation with glosm
=====================================

There are one launcher for each mode ,

./start_GPX_write_mode for write mode 
./start_GPX_read_mode for read mode 

So, o start a new simulation , lauch first ./start_GPX_write_mode
and then ./start_GPX_read_mode to observe all the traxes. 

See below for more details about the two mods. 

Principle of testing :
======================

For testing all the functions of "moving" in the map, 
i have adopted a method of writing/reading in two successive 
times.
For that, there are two mods : GPX_write_mode and GPX_write_mode.

GPX_write_mode launch glosm and the trafic-simulation at the same time.  
All the traxes of all the cars, are written in an out XLM file 
in GPX_out_thread/ .

GPX_read_mode launch glosm and open all the GPX files created in a first time.
It simply display all this traxes on the ground in red points.
By that , you can observe the trajectory and determine if they 
are corrects, if it is what have been expected.





Notes :
-------


First person Viewer Controls (glosm) :
======================================


    W or Up     - move forward
    S or Down   - move backward
    A or Left   - move left
    D or Right  - move right
    C           - move down
    Space       - move up
    L           - toggle height lock (useful for fly-by's)
    H           - same as L, but locks you at human height
    +           - increase movement speed by 5x
    -           - decrease movement speed by 5x
    Shift       - increase movement speed by 5x when pressed (SDL only)
    Ctrl        - decrease movement speed by 5x when pressed (SDL only)
    1           - toggle lowres (ground) layer
    2           - toggle hires (buildings) layer
    3           - toggle GPX layer
    4           - toggle terrain layer
    Q or Escape - close application

    Right mouse button toggles mouse grab. When grab is off, view
    may be dragged with left mouse button.
